            We offer protective agency both for shipowners (OPA) and
            charterers/cargo owners (CPA) to supervise the counterpartyâ€™s
            agent throughout the port call. As protective agents we ensure
            that your interests are well taken care of. This helps you avoid
            any conflict of interest that may arise with many stakeholders
            involved in a port call.

            Fast, reliable, transparent, available 24/7 and compliant. We
            recently had to involve Wilhelmsen as a protective agent in Port
            Sudan as we were not able to appoint/pay receiver's agent
            directly. Wilhelmsen via their Middle East office and local Sudan
            office, managed to act as a protective agent even though only
            appointed last minute. They got our vessel in and out of Sudan
            smoothly without any headaches for us.

          <h3>WHEN SHOULD YOU USE A PROTECTIVE AGENT?</h3>
          <p class="p-list">
            Having a protective agent represent you is most critical under
            these circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Unfamiliar or uncomfortable with the nominated agent</li>
            <li>Uncharted territories</li>
            <li>
              Complex governmental regime combined with high, non-transparent
              costs
            </li>
            <li>Local regulations allows only State Agent</li>

            <h3>Local knowledge</h3>
            <p>
              We are present in 2200 ports and has a global reach. We know the
              local, state and federal regulations, as well as port
              information, restrictions, supplier cost levels, etc.

            <h3>Minimise cost</h3>
            <p>
              We scrutinize the DA to ensure you are not overcharged and to
              keep your operations on schedule e.g. verifying that pilots are
              on time and that the correct amount tug boats are ordered.

            <p>
              We follow strong governance and compliance principles. With a
              protective agent, you can settle the PDA and funds through us,
              giving you more control over shipper or receivers agent as we
              are better positioned to challenge them with local know how.

              We had a vessel berthing to load iron ore where we were
              appointed owners protective agents. The shipper decided to berth
              the vessel 24 hours before they intended to start loading the
              vessel. During this idle period, the shipper still charges
              berthage charges (~AU$25,000) for the vessel being alongside. As
              the owners protective agent, we took up the argument on behalf
              of the owners and was able to get the additional berthing
              tariffs credited.

              Brazil can be a tricky place to operate with complications such
              as congestions, regulation issues and miscommunication. Towage
              costs are typically very high in Brazil - however, with our
              exclusive agreements with towage companies coupled with
              guaranteed towage availability, you can rest assured you are in
              good hands. Having us as your OPA further empowers your ship to
              be legally represented by us towards Brazilian authorities.

              At Mina Al Ahmadi, only state agents are allowed to handle
              tanker port calls. State agents typically do not share with you
              any of the information related to cargo nomination, berthing
              prospects, cargo operation and various documentation. As your
              appointed protective agent, we ensure we acquire this valuable
              information to share with you. In addition, we strive to claim
              any outstanding balance that is in your favour, to reimburse it
              back to you.

              Local partnerships are a requirement in China to be able to
              operate as a fully licenced shipping agency. Since 20 years ago,
              our joint venture partnership with Huayang Maritime Centre makes
              us the ONLY licensed agency in every port in China. This enables
              us to accurately cross check all statements of fact (SOF) and
              provide you the convenience of appointing just one protective
              agent for all your port calls in China. As a subsidiary of the
              China Waterborne Transport Research Institute (Ministry of
              Transport of China), combined with our specialization in crew
              manning, ship management and dry bulk ship operations - you can
              rest assured you're in good hands.

              In Ukraine, most full agency appointments are subject to
              receivers or shippers recommendations for their own in-house
              agencies. Having us as your second pair of eyes to overlook this
              process helps prevent any conflict of interest - Shipping agents
              may avoid noting down any negative statements against their
              shareholders in the SOF. As your protective agent, we provide
              you with alternative views and additional details of operations
              e.g. loading issues.
